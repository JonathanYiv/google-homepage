This is a project to deconstruct an existing webpage and rebuild it.
The webpages in question are the google search homepage and an actual google search results page.

The skills that I will have demonstrated on completion will be:
1) Ability to use Chrome Dev Tools
2) Ability to use Git to manage the Project
3) Comprehension of the HTML/CSS concepts behind the page
